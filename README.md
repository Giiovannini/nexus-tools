================

Nexus Tools is a simple installer for the [Android SDK Platform Tools](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools), which includes [ADB](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb.html), Fastboot, [systrace](https://developer.android.com/studio/profile/systrace-commandline.html), and other programs. These are commonly used for Android development and device modding. __Nexus Tools works on both macOS and Linux.__

The installer does not need to be downloaded, simply copy and paste this command into the Terminal and press ENTER:
```
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/corbindavenport/nexus-tools/master/install.sh)
```
To uninstall, run this command:
```
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/corbindavenport/nexus-tools/master/uninstall.sh)
```

All tools are downloaded directly from Google's servers during installation, so you're always getting the latest available versions. Once Nexus Tools is finished, you can run `adb`, `fastboot`, and other commands straight from the Terminal. To update, just run the installer again.

__Note for Linux users:__ Nexus Tools should work on all Linux distros that use Bash shell. Only x86/x86_64 platforms are supported.
